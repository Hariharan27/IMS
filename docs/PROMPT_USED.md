## Prompt 6: Product Management Implementation

**Prompt Used:**
```
# Product Management Implementation

## Business Context
We are building an inventory management system for an e-commerce business. We have successfully implemented authentication, user management, warehouse management, category management, and supplier management. Now we need to implement product management as the fourth core entity in our inventory system to create the complete product catalog with relationships to categories and suppliers.

## Technical Requirements
- Spring Boot 3.x with Java 17
- PostgreSQL database with JPA
- JWT authentication (already implemented)
- Role-based access control (ADMIN, MANAGER, STAFF)
- RESTful API endpoints
- Product catalog with category relationships
- SKU generation and management
- Comprehensive validation and error handling

## Implementation Tasks
1. Create Product entity with JPA annotations based on @DATABASE_SCHEMA.md
2. Create Product repository with custom query methods for searching and filtering
3. Create Product DTOs (Request/Response) with validation
4. Implement Product service with business logic and SKU generation
5. Create Product controller with REST endpoints based on @API_SPEC.md
6. Update security configuration for product endpoints
7. Implement proper validation and error handling
8. Test all product endpoints with authentication
9. Validate database relationships and constraints
10. Ensure API responses follow @API_SPEC.md format

## Database Schema Reference
Based on @DATABASE_SCHEMA.md, implement the products table:
- id (BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY)
- name (VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL)
- description (TEXT)
- sku (VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL)
- barcode (VARCHAR(100))
- category_id (BIGINT REFERENCES categories(id))
- supplier_id (BIGINT REFERENCES suppliers(id))
- unit_price (DECIMAL(10,2))
- cost_price (DECIMAL(10,2))
- weight (DECIMAL(8,3))
- dimensions (VARCHAR(100))
- is_active (BOOLEAN DEFAULT true)
- audit fields (created_at, updated_at, created_by, updated_by)

## API Endpoints Reference
Based on @API_SPEC.md, implement these endpoints:
- GET /api/products - List all products with pagination
- GET /api/products/{id} - Get product by ID
- GET /api/products/sku/{sku} - Get product by SKU
- GET /api/products/category/{categoryId} - Get products by category
- GET /api/products/supplier/{supplierId} - Get products by supplier
- POST /api/products - Create new product
- PUT /api/products/{id} - Update product
- DELETE /api/products/{id} - Delete product (soft delete)
- GET /api/products/search - Search products by name or description
- GET /api/products/count - Get product count

## Architecture Requirements
Based on @ARCHITECTURE.md:
- Follow Spring Boot best practices
- Use proper package structure (entity, repository, service, controller, dto)
- Implement proper exception handling
- Add comprehensive logging
- Follow RESTful API conventions
- Ensure all endpoints require JWT authentication
- Implement role-based authorization
- Handle product relationships properly

## Code Quality Requirements
- Follow Spring Boot best practices
- Use proper exception handling
- Implement comprehensive validation
- Add proper logging
- Follow RESTful API conventions
- Ensure all endpoints require JWT authentication
- Test each component thoroughly
- Use proper JPA annotations and relationships
- Implement proper DTO mapping
- Handle SKU uniqueness and generation
- Validate product relationships
- Implement proper decimal handling for prices

## Expected Deliverables
- Product entity with proper JPA mapping and relationships
- Product repository with custom queries for searching and filtering
- Product DTOs with validation
- Product service with business logic and SKU management
- Product controller with REST endpoints
- Updated security configuration
- Working API endpoints tested
- Database relationships validated
- Product catalog management working correctly

## Success Criteria
- Product CRUD operations working
- SKU uniqueness and generation functional
- Category and supplier relationships working
- JWT authentication protecting endpoints
- Proper error handling and validation
- API responses following specified format
- Database relationships working correctly
- All endpoints tested and functional
- Code follows established patterns
- Product search functionality operational
- Price and inventory data handling correctly
